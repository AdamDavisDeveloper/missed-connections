                I flexed my bicep at you, you stopped, we chatted.

                I felt a connection, wished we could have talked more.

                We were both fishing under the 41 bridge in Cartersville last weekend. 
                We talked about the best bait and you let me have some of yours. 
                I was feeling a connection but was nervous. 
                You were in red pickup and had on Nike jogging shorts and a blue tank top. 
                I hope you see this. I was the guy with the blue ford.
